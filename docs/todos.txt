Critical:
1. Modify onSwap: FIXME: Modify LogAdapter.swapCursor():
   Need to generate two views when crossing midnight
2. add decorator pattern for sleep time, so statistics are generated

Nice to have:
- limit notes to short ones so they can be displayed
  - or use additional window for displaying them.
- locale, time 24 vs 12, oz vs ml
- sharing via email
- cloud connectivity

Any other stuff?

Refactoring:
	EntryType would have to be replaced with "String" if more elements to support
	+Add abstract factory that can produce variaety of different things.
        +LogAdapter -> IDs.

	MainActivity -> switch-case in onSwiped should be replaced.

Add app indexing by Google Search:

US/EU units (Ozs vs Ml).
	Time -> AM/PM or 24H.
